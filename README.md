# Data-Science-Capstone-Johns-Hopkins-University-Coursera

## Abstract
The goal of this particular project was to create a predictive text algorithm and develop a predictive text application using
Shiny from R Studio for both the Data Science Specialization and Data Science: Machine Learning and Statistics Specialization 
for Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The project touches upon 2 areas in Natural Language Processing:

  1) N-Gram Models 
  2) Back-Off Models (Specifically Katz's Backoff Models)
  
The data set provided was from a web crawler provided by both Johns Hopkins University and Swiftkey. The finsihed result was an algorithm that goes up to a 4-gram model. I had to sample a significantly small size due to the large size of the data within the file which caused crashes on my laptop as well as app run time efficiency. To see and know on what I did specifically, please view my R presentation which can be found in this repo. However, the milestone report provided shows a markdown of the exploratory data analysis I conducted on the data set. Also, the the .rds files, app.r and final_project_app.r file are provided. The app.r file shows the code for the whole process and the final_project_app.r shows specifically the reduction of just the .rds files and the Unigram_dic.rds file to host on R Shiny Server. Enjoy!
