### Data-Science-Capstone-Johns-Hopkins-University-Coursera

##Abstract
The goal of this particular project was to create a predictive text algorithm and develop a predictive text application using
Shiny from R Studio for both the Data Science Specialization and Data Science: Machine Learning and Statistics Specialization 
for Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The project touches upon 2 areas in Natural Language Processing:

  1) N-Gram Models 
  2) Back-Off Models (Specifically Katz's Backoff Models)
  
The data set provided was from a web crawler provided by both Johns Hopkins University and Swiftkey. The finsihed result was an
algorithm that goes up to a 4-gram model and had to sample a significantly small size due to the large size of the data. To see
and know on what I did specifically, please view my R presentation which can be found in this repo.
